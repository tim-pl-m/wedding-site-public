# Wedding site

The project is currently under development, therefore futures are limited. 

A client asked for a personalized web page that will be used in the period before and after their wedding. 
Guests will be able to get the proper information they need at this site, and the bride and groom will be able to log on and register a wish list, leave information etc. 

The public repo will consist of a more general page, and not include the information of the wedding.
